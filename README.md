*DOMAIN *  :  CYBER SECURITY AND ETHICAL HACKING

* DURATION *  : 6 WEEKS

* MENTOR* :   NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

*DESCRIPTION*

This project is an Advanced Encryption Tool built using the AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It is designed to secure sensitive text data by encrypting it into unreadable cipher text and decrypting it back to the original form using a secret key. AES-256 is one of the most secure symmetric encryption methods widely used in modern cybersecurity.

The tool offers a simple GUI interface where users can input their data, choose to encrypt or decrypt it, and securely handle sensitive information like passwords, messages, or personal files.
